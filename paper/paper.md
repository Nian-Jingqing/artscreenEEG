# Summary

artscreenEEG is a MATLAB function package to perform basic artifact correction on electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Please see demo/example_steps.m for an example of how to use these functions.

This software is intended for users who wish to mitigate the muscle and electrical artifact found in all electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, whether collected from the users' own labs or collected at other locations. Note that it is the view of the authors that all EEG recordings contain some amount of artifact and software tools can only mitigate this problem, despite claims by many EEG scientists.
